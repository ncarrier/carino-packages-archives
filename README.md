# Packages integrated to the carino project in archive form

## Overview

This git repository contains the packages used by the carino project, which are
distributed under an archive form. No modification is made on the content of the
archives, which are publicly made releases of the corresponding projects, by the
original authors.  
When modifications are made (it is not the case for now), they are provided as
patches along with the concerned tarballs. When a package will have too much
patches or if it must be modified regularly, then it is candidate to move to
it's own clone repository, to ease the tracking of the modifications made.

## Licenses

### For each package

Each package is open source and is provided shipped with the original licensing
information of the packages.  
The distribution is made along with the entire build system and provides tools
for "flashing on target". If this proves not to satisy any of the terms of one
of the software's license, please be kind to inform the author of the steps
needed to be fully compliant.
